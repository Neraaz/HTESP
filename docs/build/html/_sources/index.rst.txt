Introducing HTEPC, the High Throughput Electronic Structure Package, designed for Quantum Espresso (QE) and VASP simulations. HTEPC streamlines input file preparation from the Materials Project database and offers a wide range of functionalities, from basic ground-state calculations to advanced electron-phonon studies and superconductivity analyses. With seamless integration with QE and VASP, HTEPC empowers researchers to explore complex material landscapes, automate calculations, and investigate material electronic structures efficiently.


To Do ......

 1. Include oqmd and aflow database (Done).

 2. Include elastic constant calculations (Done).

 3. include info process for vasp.

 4. Finish Documentation.

 5. Put a separate section for process and its utility.

 6. Put a process to group compounds from different database. May be using pymatgen structure matcher.

 7. Make code free of documentation text other than the code.

 8. Include plot variables in htepc.json file.
