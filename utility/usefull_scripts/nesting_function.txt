1. relax the structure
2. Get eigen values for different bands and k-vector.
   For denser mesh, can use wannier function 
   1. For SrAl4, 120x120x100 k-mesh is used.
   2. plot normal band structure and orbital projected DOS ( to choose projectors ) for different atoms
   3. chose frozen windows (1 eV above and below Ef) and disentanglement windows to include all the
      wannier projections.
   4. With this, we will get eigenvalues in .eig file
   5. Real part of the nesting function or suceptibility function is
     Re chi (q) = sum_k=1_to_Nband fkn - fk'm/(e_nk - e_mk'), 	 q = k-k'

     fkn and fk'm are occupation number, 2 for valence band, and 0 for conduction band
     and forbit the transition within condunction or valence regions. m and n are band indices

   6. Imaginary part of the nesting function is
    for k-k' = q
    Im chi (q) = sum_k=1_to_Nband delta(enk-Ef)delta(emk'-Ef)


# Supercell for CDW
1. find unstable modes and eigenvectors.
2. create supercell depending on 1/q_i . if instability is on q = (0.5,0.5,0.5) then use 2x2x2 supercell
3. Displace ion only one part of the supercell (out of 8 part) according to eigenvectors
4. Relax the systems
