Utility folder contains subfolders that has some extra scripts to perform various tasks

1. distortion contains the scripts to extract unique ground-state energies among relaxing various structures corresponding to different modes.

2. input_files: htepc.json file (main input file), and other secondary input "*.in" files

3. useful_scripts: Some useful python scripts. 

4. sample_pp contains pseudopotentials from SSSP PBE dataset.

Read the descriptions inside the scripts to learn more.

5. Relaxation
   check whether instability arises in electronic or ionic iteration.
   if ionic, consider using small ionic step and resubmit relaxation with updated 
   structure, change cell optimization parameters

   #if electronic,
   consider changing scf optimization parameters
