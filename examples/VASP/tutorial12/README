For volume change, one can use fractional number to scale lattice vector, such as .90, .98,....1.08

For pressure change, use integer pressure in kbar such as 1, 100, 1000. Do not use float number here.

Once we have relaxed structure, use "pressure.in" file to generate input files with different volume or pressure.

Execute:

mainprogram pressure-input

to generate input files.
