Copy input.in, mpid.in, run-vasp.sh, vasp.in, and Rmp-763-Mg1B2 file (from tutorial9 after relaxation)

Adjust "strain" keyword in config.json file and prepare input files with

mainprogram elastic-input

For this step, input.in will be
---------------------------
1
2
.....
mpid.in
....
DFT = VASP
---------------------------

Rmp-763-1-Mg1B2, ......, Rmp-763-24-Mg1B2 folders are created along with mpid-deformed.in file.

Now, use mpid-deformed.in in "input.in", change starting and ending index based on this file to perform
calculations.

---------------------------
1
25
.....
mpid-deformed.in
....
DFT = VASP
---------------------------

Perform ionic relaxation with combination of following commands

mainprogram 1
mainprogram 2 and
mainprogram 3

similarly as in tutorial9.


Once finished, change "mpid-deformed.in" to "mpid.in" and adjust indices to compute elastic properties

---------------------------
1
2
.....
mpid.in
....
DFT = VASP
---------------------------

Execute command:

mainprogram elastic-compute. Elastic properties are stored in "elastic.csv" file.
