Start from tutorial9.

With pressure.in file having scale parameters for lattice vectors,

one can obtain input files for different volumes by executing:

mainprogram pressure-input

Now, run relaxation keeping volume fixed with

mainprogram 26

Repeat multiple times until all the systems are fully converged.

Finally, collect the volume energies data with

mainprogram ev-collect

To obtain equation of state, execute:

mainprogram eos-bm

or 

mainprogram eos-vinet

This creates eos-fit.dat file with results.
