1. First perform normal ground state calculations (ionic and electronic relaxation)
2. Phonon calculation at single q point such as Gamma point (q=0,0,0)
3. Diagonalize dynamical matrix using dynmat.x that produces dynmat.axsf file.
4. Write a header file "scf-header.in" without any lattice parameters.
5. To perform further relaxation on these different modes. Use command: "band-distort-scan start end" (starting mode to ending mode). Total mode = 3*N(number of ions).
6. Perform calculation with 'scf' to check whether modes having same symmetry have the same total energies. Once it is okay.
7. We can performed full relaxation using 'vc-relax' in scf-header.in.
8. Use command: "energy-distort-scan start end" to collect the results (relaxed structure in cif/ folder and total energies
in Energy_mode.csv file.
9. Use a job submission script with name "run.sh" along with all the necessary files in  working directory.
