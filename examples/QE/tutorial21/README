1. After relaxation, get input.in, config.json, mpid.in, Rmp-763-Mg1B2, and scf_dir folders with
scf-mp-763.in and scf-relax-mp-763-Mg1B2.in in it.

change magmom type to "ordering" in config.json

Now, with adjusting input.in starting and ending indices, execute:

mainprogram magenum 

command to obtain mpid-magnetic.in files and bunch of different scf-mp-763-j.in, j = 1,2,3....
corresponding to different structures with magnetic ordering will be generated.
