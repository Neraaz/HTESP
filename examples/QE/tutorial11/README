Here, Let's compute superconductivity for MgB2.

Copy batch.header from tutorial1

copy scf_dir folder, input.in, mpid.in, Rmp-763-Mg1B2 folder, config.json, pp folder from tutorial9.

Make kpoint even with "kpoint.in" file. Execute:

mainprogram change_k

With even k-mesh, its easier to choose qmesh as integer fraction of kmesh.

Also, we use "qpoint.in" file. Instead of 3 number, one can also use a number that would divide
k-mesh to get q-mesh.

Now, execute:

mainprogram 4

to prepare input files for various other scf and el-ph calculations.

Execute:

mainprogram 5

to compute charge density and wavefunctions for denser mesh. Code use denser mesh
twice that of k-mesh.

To perform scf calculation on coarse grid,

mainprogram 6

Execute:

mainprogram 7

to perform electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculations

mainprogram 8

to run q2r.x to get force constant in real space

mainprogram 9

to run matdyn.x for obtaining phonon dispersion in high-symmetry K-path.

mainprogram 10 

to run matdyn.x for computing phonon DOS and other EPC quantities

mainprogram 11

to run lambda.x for computing superconducting properties.

mainprogram 12 

to run phonband.x for processing phonon dispersion

mainprogram 19 for plotting.

In fifth line of "input.in",

use "phband" keyword to plot alpha^2F and a simple phonon bandstructure
use "gammaband" to plot mode resolved EPC projected phonon dispersion
use "phonproj" to plot atom-projected phonon dispersion

Look at the plots folder in reference for a sample.


# For q-point parallel calculations.

One can also compute elph calculations for different q vector and later
collect the results.

For this set, "elph_mode": "parallel_q"

and execute:

mainprogram 4
mainprogram 5
mainprogram 6
mainprogram 7

Once completed again execute the same command to collect the result.

# For q-point and irreducible representations parallelization.

For this first, set

"elph_mode": "only_init"

and exectue:
mainprogram 4
mainprogram 5
mainprogram 6
mainprogram 7

Once it obtains the elph.out files (output), then extract
number of irreducible representations by executing:

First change "elph_mode": "parallel_irr"

mainprogram 4

Since 5 and 6 process have been already finished. Now jump to process = 7.

mainprogram 7
mainprogram 7 to collect results.

If you want to rerun any of q and irr calculations, simply remove
ELPH_Q_IR_SUBMITTED file inside calc directory, change loop structure inside ph-scan
script (from line 78) in bash folder of the source code. 

and resubmit with
mainprogram 7
