Once structure is relaxed with tutorial9.

Prepare input files for different volume using "pressure.in". This creates inputs file by
changing volumes isotropically by executing:

mainprogram pressure-input

Check scf_dir folder for input files.

Execute:

mainprogram 26

to perform scf calculations with different isotropic volumes by allowing change in shape.
Repeat the command, until the systems are fully relaxed.

After finishing, execute:

mainprogram ev-collect

to collect volume-energy data in "e-v.dat" inside Rmp-763-Mg1B2/pressure folder.

Now one can calculate equation of state quantities with

mainprogram eos-bm or

mainprogram eos-vinet
