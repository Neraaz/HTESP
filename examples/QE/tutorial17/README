Once relaxed, using tutorial9.

One can start QE+phonopy calculations. Prepare input files with displacement and submit scf calculations by executing:

mainprogram phono1

If "setting.conf" file is provided, displacement is read from this file. Otherwise, code will
create 2x2x2 supercell by default.

After the calculations are finished for all structures,

Execute "mainprogram phono2" to compute the force constant. Similarly, process = "phono3" for
calculating thermodynamic quantities, process = "phono4" for plotting phonon bandstructure.
