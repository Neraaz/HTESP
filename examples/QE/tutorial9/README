First, edit jobscript run-scf.sh to include your batch submission script.

Start performing relaxation by executing:

mainprogram 1

after calculation finishes, extract the total energy by executing:

mainprogram e0

This will produce econv.csv. Check "niteration". If it is larger than 2, then resubmit calculations
as follows.

First update input file with

mainprogram 2

resubmit the calculations with

mainprogram 3

Again extract the total energy with "mainprogram e0" and check niteration.

Repeat, process = 2 and 3 simultaneously until niteration becomes 2.
