To prepare input files after relaxation (tutorial9), execute:

```
mainprogram 4
```

For wannierization, execute:

```
mainprogram epw1
```

To prepare further necessary input files.

For preparing wannier90 input files, utilize band structure and partial DOS (pDOS) information (tutorial12) to define energy windows for disentanglement and projections (wannier functions).

Use wannier90.json files along with the necessary input files.

Update the "job_script" dictionary with the necessary commands to create the job submission script "run-wannier_band.sh" using:

```
mainprogram jobscript
```

Finally, prepare input files with the "projection.in" file that contains projections. If not found, random projections are used.

Execute:

```
mainprogram wann-file
```

Make sure to adjust pw2wan.in and ex.win according to your requirements.
