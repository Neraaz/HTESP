check input_data['conv_test'] dictionary for convergence tests parameter.

Currently, only ecut and kpoint convergence are available.

change input_data['conv_test']['param'] to 'ecut' for kinetic energy cutoff convergence tests

change to 'kpoint' for kpoint convergence test.

To run the test, execute:

mainprogram convtest

To extract the result:

mainprogram 22

Total energy will be in Ry per unit cell. Change to eV/atom
