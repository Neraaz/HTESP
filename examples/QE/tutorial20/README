Once we have relaxed structure, use "charge.in" file to generate input files with different total charge.
For QE, +Ve charge represents removing electrons, while -Ve charge represents the adding electronic charge.

Execute:

mainprogram charge-input

to generate input files inside scf_dir and mpid-charge.in file.
