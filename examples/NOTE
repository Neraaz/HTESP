1. To perform the examples, please rename the `mpid.in` and `mpid-list.in` files located in the reference folders. This code searches for these files across all folders. This behavior may be changed in the future if necessary.

2. Ensure that the path to the VASP or QE executables is correctly set in your `~/.bashrc` file.

3. If you need to specify the path to executables manually, you can do so within the `run-scf.sh`, `run-vasp.sh`, and other similar batch submission scripts for the computer cluster.
